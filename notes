No pictures

Bad color scheme

Green doesn’t make me think pizza

Fonts are different colors

Change Font to something Italian

Plain white covers most the menu

Header is messed up and doesn’t display properly

Header covers nav tabs

Nav tabs on the top and again on the side (redundant)

Extra nav tab that does nothing

None of the pages are responsive

Home Page:

No text, just a picture

Header doesn’t grab attention

Location Page

Map on location page is just an image and not interactive

Font isn’t really readable

Map isn’t clickable to zoom

Menu

Text is off center

Menu not organized well

Needs pictures!

I plan to change everything that I don’t like about the page. If I have time after that, I will consider adding a contact page with a form so that you can easily contact them. I will also add a reviews page attached to a mongo database running off an express server. To review:

 

Add contact page

Page should accept the user’s phone, email, name, and comments

Contact page should submit to an email (fake email for now)

Reviews page

This page will have an input area for reviews

It will accept the name, number of stars, and comment

A timestamp will also be added

Add a google map using the API for location
